MATPLOTLIB LEARNING DATASET - COLUMN GUIDE
==========================================

This dataset is designed to teach matplotlib progressively. Here's what each column enables:

TEMPORAL ANALYSIS:
- date: Line plots over time, time series
- month: Grouped bar charts by month
- quarter: Seasonal comparisons
- day_of_week: Weekly patterns

NUMERIC DISTRIBUTIONS:
- amount: Histograms, distribution plots
- quantity: Count-based plots
- discount_percent: Percentage-based visualizations
- revenue: Primary metric for most plots
- customer_rating: Scatter plot correlations

CATEGORICAL GROUPING:
- category: Group by product type (5 categories)
- region: Geographic comparisons (4 regions)
- payment_method: Payment type analysis (4 methods)

BINARY FILTERS:
- is_member: Compare member vs non-member
- is_online: Online vs offline transactions

LEARNING PATH MAPPING:
======================

1. SINGLE PLOT, SINGLE VARIABLE:
   - Line: revenue over date
   - Bar: total revenue by category
   - Histogram: distribution of amount

2. BASIC CUSTOMIZATION:
   - Use any of the above with titles, labels, colors

3. MULTIPLE ELEMENTS, SAME PLOT:
   - Multiple lines: revenue by region over time
   - Multiple bars: revenue by category for each quarter
   - Overlayed histograms: amount distribution by is_member

4. DIFFERENT PLOT TYPES:
   - Combine line (revenue over time) + bar (by category) + scatter (amount vs rating)

5. GROUPED CATEGORICAL:
   - One line per region showing revenue over time
   - Grouped bars: category revenue by payment_method
   - Stacked bars: category breakdown by region

6. SUBPLOTS:
   - Grid of plots: one per region or category
   - Shared axes: compare regions with aligned scales

7. STYLING:
   - Add legends for multiple lines/bars
   - Rotate x-axis labels for date/category
   - Annotate maximum values

8. FIGURE CONTROL:
   - Multiple axes: main revenue + quantity subplot
   - Twin axes: revenue and customer_rating on same plot

9. OUTPUT:
   - Save any plot to PNG
